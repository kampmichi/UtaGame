    ud "Try picking up the hammer."
    
    u "Lighter than before, perhaps even feeling something weird..."
    u "Almost feel like I able to feel it... from the hammer itself."
    
    ud "Excellent, this is one of the unique blacksmith's skill! Enchantment."
    ud "Now go and pick up the sword I prepared, you should be able to use your enchantment skill."
    
    u "(Sounds easy enough.)"
    u "Enchantment!"
    
    ud "Not bad for first try."
    ud "You would need some pratice before you can fully utilize your skill."
    ud "I know you can do better than just 20%% buff for normal sword."
    
    u "Honestly, this doesn't sound too bad."
    u "For my skill and this sword of course."
    
    ud "I would say you need to get around 50%% as your next target, and 100%% is when you can be an actual smith."
    ud "Don't get too cocky with your skill, we as blacksmith are the backbones of everyone's tools."
    ud "Iron ore don't come in cheap too, especially during war time."
    ud "There's a lot you need to learn, so stay frosty."
    
    u "Sure, I could handle that, I guess."
    u "(Enchantment feels like an useful skill to have, would try to make my gear one day!)"
    u "Why don't I gather the iron ore myself? It's not like we aren't allow to enter the caves."
    
    ud "Good question, the answer is we sometimes do gather our own resources but we also need the time for smithing."
    ud "Not all caves are safe, so don't try to 'explore' as if you are one of the adventurers."
    ud "Chopping wood is fine, perhaps you need more for your personal smithing, then the Gaven Cave is a good place to start."
    
    u "Will visit it one day!"
    
    ud "Just to be clear, I don't think you would find anything interesting, even though it is a cave."
    ud "There are other people working there too, so it is safe and secure."
    
    u "I don't mind, I mean I never been to one."
    
    ud "Right, just don't keep your hopes too much."
