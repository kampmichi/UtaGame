    u "Hmm..."
    u "Doesn't seem like I'm getting anything special."
    u "I can actually feel all the stuff my dad told me about kinda."
    u "Like I could summon a flame if I really wanted... likely I already gained fire resistance too and am a bit stronger and maybe if I put my heart into something I smish..."
    u "..."
    u "You know what? Even if it is that I do want to summon a flame, better do it outside tho I don't want to accedentaly burn down the house."

    menu:
        "How do I get outside without my Dad catching me?"
        "Jump through the window":
            "It's the simplest way to get outside , no stairs to worry about, plus I am not that high up and I should be tougher now."
            "Opening the window I climb on the edge before jumping off."
            "Ha That landing felt easier then I expected!"
        "Sneak through the House":
            "I open my door and start slowly treading downstairs."
            "..."
            "*creak*"
            "..."
            "I really hope nobody gets woken up by this."
            "Once I reach the ground floor everything is queter I just move to the door and exit, and don't slam the door behind me."
            "I should go to the backside of the house since dad and mom sleep with the window to the street."
            "I hurry up and move to the back."
        "Now then!"
        "The blessing of the fire spirit grants one the ability to summon fire and when concentrateing even heat it up to 3000 Degrees, the only downside is that the range is really bad."
        "I go into position, holding my hands as a cone behind me then chargeing forward!"
        "Fire CG HERE"
        u "WOAH!"
        "..."
        "*pinch*"
        u "AMAZING!!!"
        "This is nothing at all like the small flame of my father or grandfather! This thing was HUGE! At least the size of two or three rooms!"
        u "This is on the level of a combat skill!"
        u "Wait... maybe that is my combat skill?!"
        "I try blasting off a few more."
        "bssshhh , bsshhh , bssshhh , bsssshhhh"
        u "No way! It's really real!"
        "I continue blasting off into the sky for some time until."

        ud "Uta?!"
        u "Dad?! Look!"
        "I fire off a shot into she sky eclipseing the hight of our house easily."
        "When I looked at the face of my father, he was astonished as well but then looked worried."
        u "Dad... I "
        ud "Come with me to the workshop."
        u "I don't just want to be a-"
        ud "You can travel if you pass my test."
        "I quickly rushed besides him as we go back inside."
        ud "Uta, honestly ... now haveing seen your skill I know I can't hold you here forever."
        ud "I actually never thought I really could for long but I want you to not just be another adventurer."
        ud "We are a smithing family and I still belive you have the blessing so my challange to you is to craft your own gear here in this workshop and in the forge before you head out."
        ud "You don't get any materials from me, but you know about Gaven Cave and you can have my pickaxe if the miners don't help you out."
        "I can't help but hug my dad for thinking about me this much!"
        ud "Ah! Uta you are hugging too hard!"
        u "Oops!"
        ud "This girl of mine really has gotten strong huh."
        u "Hehe, now you are finaly on the other end!"
        ud "Now that you know, I think we should both go back to bed."

    ud "Try picking up the hammer."
    
    u "Lighter than before, perhaps even feeling something weird..."
    u "Almost feel like I able to feel it... from the hammer itself."
    
    ud "Excellent, this is one of the unique blacksmith's skill! Enchantment."
    ud "Now go and pick up the sword I prepared, you should be able to use your enchantment skill."
    
    u "(Sounds easy enough.)"
    u "Enchantment!"
    
    ud "Not bad for first try."
    ud "You would need some pratice before you can fully utilize your skill."
    ud "I know you can do better than just 20%% buff for normal sword."
    
    u "Honestly, this doesn't sound too bad."
    u "For my skill and this sword of course."
    
    ud "I would say you need to get around 50%% as your next target, and 100%% is when you can be an actual smith."
    ud "Don't get too cocky with your skill, we as blacksmith are the backbones of everyone's tools."
    ud "Iron ore don't come in cheap too, especially during war time."
    ud "There's a lot you need to learn, so stay frosty."
    
    u "Sure, I could handle that, I guess."
    u "(Enchantment feels like an useful skill to have, would try to make my gear one day!)"
    u "Why don't I gather the iron ore myself? It's not like we aren't allow to enter the caves."
    
    ud "Good question, the answer is we sometimes do gather our own resources but we also need the time for smithing."
    ud "Not all caves are safe, so don't try to 'explore' as if you are one of the adventurers."
    ud "Chopping wood is fine, perhaps you need more for your personal smithing, then the Gaven Cave is a good place to start."
    
    u "Will visit it one day!"
    
    ud "Just to be clear, I don't think you would find anything interesting, even though it is a cave."
    ud "There are other people working there too, so it is safe and secure."
    
    u "I don't mind, I mean I never been to one."
    
    ud "Right, just don't keep your hopes too much."
