    mn "Sure, you can have as much as possible."
    mn "You saved our lives, this is the only way we can give back to you."
    mn "Raw ores are not in demand these days, we are struggling to make a living."
    
    u "That sounds bad, I would like to help you..."
    
    mn "Nah, this is our problems, sorry kid, we can handle it ourselves!"
    
    u "(You just saved by a kid though.)"
    u "I will be taking these."
    u "(I struck my hands into the wall, pulling out the full piece out of it!)"
    u "Hehe! This looks just like a crystal!"
    
    mn "Smith girl... May I ask why are you so strong?"
    mn "You also defeated the golbin witch all by yourself, that's crazy!"
    
    u "I don't know but I need to get my stuff back home now."
    u "Dad is not going to like me missing out on the time."
