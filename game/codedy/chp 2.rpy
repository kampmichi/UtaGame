    u "Did I just do that?"

    u "Hehe, but I'm just a smith."
    
    mn "A, what?"
    
    u "A smith girl, you know, I'm here for some raw ore."
    u "Would be grateful if you show me where the goods are, hehe~"
    
    mn "Okay... Sure, this way please."
    "The miner shows the rich minerals fields, as well as some pickaxes laying on the ground."

    u "Shiny~ Can I have them?"
    
    mn "Sure, you can have as much as possible."
    mn "You saved our lives, this is the only way we can give back to you."
    mn "Raw ores are not in demand these days, we are struggling to make a living."
    
    u "That sounds bad, I would like to help you..."
    
    mn "Nah, this is our problems, sorry kid, we can handle it ourselves!"
    
    u "(You just saved by a kid though.)"
    u "I will be taking these."
    u "(I struck my hands into the wall, pulling out the full piece out of it!)"
    u "Hehe! This looks just like a crystal!"
    
    mn "Smith girl... May I ask why are you so strong?"
    mn "You also defeated the golbin witch all by yourself, that's crazy!"
    
    u "Hehe, I not really sure how I did that."
    u "But I will need more so bye for now!"
    
    mn "Wait!"
    "..."
    mn "She's gone now, we don't even know her name."
    mn "Do you think she can be the next hero?"
    mn "Who knows man, I can only hope we can get back home alive after what we been through today."
    mn "Agree..."
    
    u "(Deeper inside the cave, things are looking quite different than the surface.)"
    u "Something tells me I shouldn't be here but oh well."
    u "(I just realize I can see clearly in complete dark!)"
    
    m "Rrrrr..."
    
    u "(Ah I can see them, seems like it's just golbins.)"
    u "You guys again? Bad golbins..."
    u "(I kill them in such speed that I could see their heads are stationary on air after I slide my hand towards the necks.)"
    u "(They are no match to me.)"

    u "I would never expect my skin becomes this hard."
    
    m "?!"

    u "(Feeling the fragile bones, I smash it to the wall and tear it apart like I break egg's shell.)"
    u "(The sharp shiv I picked it up and throw it on a rock.)"
    u "(It's much sharper than I thought, cutting it through like paper.)"
